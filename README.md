# Notesify
A note-taking app supercharged with the power of AI

## Inspiration
We understand the struggle of juggling multiple websites just to study for a single test. Whether it’s switching between note-taking tools, calculators, or reference materials, the process can be overwhelming. And let’s be honest—how many times have you found yourself opening Symbolab every time you hit a roadblock? We’ve been there too, and that’s exactly why we built **Notesify**.
